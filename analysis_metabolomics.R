# Correlation of FCS for all data and for every drug. See if we have any R/S grouping.. get insights on this
# Compare metabolomics results for R/Sgroups, and see which one is better
# check which metabolites are driving the correlation, hopefully positive controls
# Correlate FC with GR50 and GR24
# For metabolic drugs: check if direct substrate/products involved in MoA are relating to any drug metric 
# Multiomics: Link protein/gene/mRNA levels to metabolomics/drug sensitivity
# Multiomics: distance_to_target analysis
