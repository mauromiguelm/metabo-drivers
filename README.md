# Metabolic drivers of drug sensitivity in cancer cell lines

## Introduction

To reveal the contribution of metabolism to drug sensitivity, we screened 31 drugs across 21 cancer cell lines at 5 logs of concentration, generating over 34.000 metabolic profiles coupled to 1 Mio images of over 3000 treatment groups as shown in Figure 1. From these results, we provide a map of drug-metabolite interactions that are general across many cell lines, several being independent of drug growth effect, a known confounder in metabolomics analysis. We discovered 703 drug-metabolite interactions, 488 of them being involved resistance and 215 in sensitivity. Of those, 599 are independent of drug growth effect â€“ i.e. happens prior to growth effects in the concentration domain.

## Installation

Install package confluencer:
```R
 if(!require(confluencer)) {
  devtools::install_github("mauromiguelm/confluencer")
}
```

From the terminal: `start myproject.Rproj`
